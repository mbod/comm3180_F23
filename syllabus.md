# IMPORTANT NOTICES


## 1. Wearing a mask is **REQUESTED** in this class

-   To reduce the risk of infection and increase the possibility of
    wellness allowing us to focus on learning and working together, it
    is requested that you consider wearing a face mask
    fully covering both mouth and nose *before* you enter the classroom
    and keep it in place *at all times*.

-   Make sure you have a "properly-fitting, high-quality mask (preferably
    a surgical mask, KN95/KF94, N95, or
    [EHRS-recommended
    Aries mask](https://ehrs.upenn.edu/covid-19/mask-guidance-march-15-2022) as opposed to a single layer cloth mask)." (UPenn Public
    Health Guidance).

-   This is a request for us to think socially about how our choices
    impact others and how we can maximize learning opportunities. There
    is some data and a infographic you can critique as budding data
    scientists at <https://bit.ly/MMWR7106>. **Please respect each other's
    choices on this issue**.

-   The information and advice on [this page](https://www.georgetown.edu/coronavirus/) (from a different
    educational institution) is helpful.


## 2. ZOOM AND CLASS RECORDINGS

-   **ZOOM AND CLASS ATTENDANCE WHEN UNWELL** - If you feel sick or are
    showing symptoms of Covid-19, flu or cold then **PLEASE BE
    CONSIDERATE** of your classmates and attend the class remotely
    through Zoom. All class sessions will be available live through Zoom (see links in Canvas) and as recordings.

## Course Description, Goals and Objectives

Today masses of data are available everywhere, capturing information on just about everything and anything. Related but distinct data streams about newsworthy events and issues &#x2013; including activity from social media and open data sources (eg: The Open Government Initiative) &#x2013; have given rise to a new source for and style of reporting sometimes called Data Journalism. Increasingly, news sites and information portals present visually engaging, dynamic, and interactive stories linked to the underlying data (e.g. The Guardian DataBlog, LA Times Data Desk). The Covid-19 pandemic has amplified this trend.

This course offers an introduction to Python programming for data analysis and visualization. Students will learn how to collect, analyze, and present various forms of data. Second, because numbers and their visualizations do not speak for themselves but require context, interpretation, and narrative, students will practice making effective stories from data and presenting them in blogs, articles and other formats.

No prior programming experience is required. Through this course students will gain skills writing Python programs to handle large amounts of data and become familiar with some of the key techniques used by data scientists, which is currently one of the most in-demand jobs.

-   This course will provide an introduction to Python programming for
    collecting, cleaning, describing and analyzing a range of publicly
    available datasets, including demographic (e.g., age, race,
    education levels by geographic area), medical (e.g. Covid infection
    and vacination, ER intakes for certain conditions like flu, measles,
    etc), financial (e.g., spending on infrastructure, education, other
    initatives, income distribution, etc.), event (e.g., crime data,
    road accidents) and transportation (e.g., usage statistics for
    public transportation and private schemes, e.g. bike shares).

-   Each week one session will be in lecture form and provide background
    for the theory and techniques and the second will be a lab session
    in which students will work through programming exercises using
    Jupyter notebooks (a web-based programming environment well suited
    for data science and class-based assignments). Often there will be a
    video lecture to watch before the session.

-   By completing this course students will:
    -   gain an understanding of how data can be used to support the
        reporting and making of news and other types of storytelling
    -   practice skills of making stories by collecting, transforming,
        visualizing and analyzing publicly available data
    -   explore the range of various kinds of data now available through
        initiatives such as Open Government Data initiative (data.gov) and
        a range of other available and curated data archives
    -   be exposed to a range of techniques from data journalism, data
        science and information visualization and understand how they can
        be used to tell news/media stories
    -   gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the Python
        programming language and have completed a number of programming
        exercises to collect, clean, analyze, visualize and interpret such
        data

# Assessment

1.  ****Attend weekly lab sessions and complete the assigned readings and exercises (40%)****
    -   Wednesday class sessions will usually be programming labs. We will be using Jupyter notebooks to learn Python, which are part of a web-based interactive programming environment. You must have a github account to access the server. If you do not have an account go to <https://github.com/join> and set one up. Assignments will be completed in this environment and submitted to the instructor. Details of using this system for assignments will be covered in the first lab session.
    -   Assignments will usually be due at <span class="underline"><span class="underline">11.59 p.m. (EST) on the Friday</span></span> (but this may vary). These assignments are intended to help students practice the programming concepts and structures introduced in lab and build confidence. They should not be difficult or take excessive time but they do build from week to week so it is <span class="underline">very</span> important to keep up.

2.  ****Complete a <span class="underline">data story project</span> that uses the techniques and theory covered in class to carry out a data analysis of a specific research question agreed upon with the instructor (60%)****
    -   More details of the kinds of projects that would be appropriate and manageable will be discussed during the first few weeks of class.
    
    -   The key steps of the project will be scheduled throughout the course allowing for the instructor to help you find a manageable problem, acquire the necessary data and be able to carry out the appropriate computational analysis.
    
    -   We will discuss the expected structure and components of the project. Some elements will be assessed on an individual basis (e.g. in your group you will each be responsible for one of the data sources relevant to your research question and you will carry out the acquisition, inspection, cleaning and exploration steps on that data source) and others will be graded as a group (e.g. the initial and final project presentations and the project blog)

# Note about learning programming

-   One of the aims of this class is to help students begin to develop
    data analysis and programming skills that they can use as a part of
    carrying out research. But like learning any new skill, such as a
    new spoken language, it takes time and can be frustrating at
    first. This course does not require students to have any programming
    background. Realistically it is not possible to become a fully
    proficient programmer in just one semester. However, the lab
    sessions and assignments are focused on helping you begin this
    process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding and
    modifying Python and R code examples that you can find on the web
    etc.

-   **Using generative AI tools** - We will talk more about the potential
    benefits and drawbacks of using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT
    and Copilot to learn programming as the course progresses. There is
    neither a blanket prohibition or full encouragement for the use of
    these developing tools in this course. I will provide more guidance
    as we go along.

# Schedule


## **NOTE** This is a tentative schedule is will be updated as the course progresses


## Class structure

-   Usually each class session will be divided into two parts:

-   **Content and Discussion** - This part of the class will introduce
    and review the key topics onlined in the schedule. It is important
    that you read the assigned material BEFORE the class as you'll be
    expected to engage in discussion and other activities based on this
    content.
-   **Lab activities** - The second part will be focused on pratical
    exercises to put into practice what we have been learning about
    thinking about, collecting, analyzing, interpreting and
    communicating data.
